% At the end the parameters omega_r (= time frequency) and alpha_r (= wavelength) of the TS mode (from Orr-Sommerfeld eq) are correct and I am getting amplification in the amplitudes of the waves, as expected when blowing and suction. . I think last time I swapped them or anything even worse... Anyway the solver is correct. But in order to compute n(x) = max_omega m(x)

	\frametitle{Comments}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item I realized I input the wrong frequency when blowing and suction, up to a factor of 1.72. Now I am redoing the computations. Could that explain that all the curves where clustered together?
	  \item I also try global stability analysis with the coupled approach, which worked (so far with low polynomial order), but it only does $kdim$ iterations and $kdim$ is bounded by 500 in the code. Why?
