So far I have simulated the Incompressible Navier Sotkes code using Ganlin's settings as a reference. The problem is that his settings files are different from the settings specified in his thesis. Also I put bad top boundary condition (free stream). I just put u=1, intead of u=xx*cos(), w=yy*sin().

The I ran the linearized code with a specific baseflow (not average them in time, just the last slide of the simulation).
