 * Today I learned the *Arnoldi iteration* for finding the largest eigenvalue of a general matrix. It consists on, given a random initial vector $b$, to apply the power iteration to the matrix $A$ and the vector $b$, that is, compute $Ab$, $A^2b$, $A^3b$. This converges eventually to the largest eigenvector of $A$, because of the general decomposition $A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$, with $Q$ being the matrix of eigenvectors and $\Lambda$ the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

 * For TriGlobal analysis, when the perturbated solution is assumed to be of the form $u(x,t)=sum_j a_i q(x) e^{\lambda_j t}$, just think in separation of variables to deduce this formula, when we are in the linearized case of NS: $\partial_t u = L u$, with $L$ being the linearized operator of the Navier-Stokes equations.

Summary of the linear, biglobal and triglobal stability analysis:
