# Dependence on the basin of attraction of the Steady state

Remember the case with Re = 1000, d = 4 and studying the dependence in width.

The case with w = 16.35 was globally stable but w = 16.5 not. 

But I wanted to study how big was the basin of attraction of the point. So I started a simulation with an initial condition the steady state of stable case w = 16.35 (interpolated to the mesh of w = 16.5, using FieldConvert utility) and then the simulation converged to an stable state!!!! So be very careful with the dependence on the parameters!!!!!
