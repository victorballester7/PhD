Scotch: we need to compile iot from source in order to include the -fPIC flag. Otherwise the building of nektar will fail and we will have to enable THIRD_PARTY_SCOTCH, which also gives problems.

So clone Scotch into .cache/yay/scotch and compile it with the following commands:
  cd src
  mkdir build && cd build
  CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make -j8
  make install


Problems with Cmake version fro gsmpi. Add 

  -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5

to the files /home/victor/Desktop/nektar++/build/CMakeFiles/gsmpi-1.2.1_2.dir/build.make (precisely under the ThirdParty/stamp/gsmpi-1.2.1_2-configure: ThirdParty/stamp/gsmpi-1.2.1_2-patch section), where all the other flags are located (search for -DCMAKE). This solved the problem with the CMake version.
