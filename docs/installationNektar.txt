Scotch: we need to compile iot from source in order to include the -fPIC flag. Otherwise the building of nektar will fail and we will have to enable THIRD_PARTY_SCOTCHm, which also gives problems.

So clone Scotch into .cache/yay/scotch and compile it with the following commands:
  cd src
  mkdir build && cd build
  CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make -j8
  make install
