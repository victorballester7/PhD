- do jeffrey slides for next week
- put nonlinear results (all range of width)



RUNS for next week:
- play with the parameters of SFD, to see whether we reduce the error between the baseflow created and the nonlinear results (after adding the mode to the baseflow)
- try to match the decrease in u (by amplifying the mode a little bit above the stable convergeed baseflow (plot of u))
- try robin BC from Dong paper



Theoretical notes:
- First part that the solver does is solve poisson eq for preassure, so when I add the perturbated mode (which doesn't have preassure) to the baseflow I can set the preassure to zero to that file.
