Some notes to clarify concepts:

- Solving the Orr-Somerfeld Squire (OSS) equation is for knowing the ts lengthscale. 
- with transient growth we would see TS waves as the interactions of the most usntable modes
- ts wave is convective instability
- OSS is to detect the local convective instability. For absolute instability, we use the normal approach (Arnoldi method on linearized NS)
- try to create a diagram like lecture 19, page 16 of Yongyun, but with varying width of the gap instead of Re.
- in orr-squire BC are fine, I just need to change the stretching of the grid (I think it's defined for the BL). If I have doubts, check book "Canuto et al. 1988 Spectral Method in Fluid Dynamics".
