Questions:
  1. Can you repeat me why all the people put an inflow of balsuius profile, instead of just using u=1 or whatever more simple?
  2. Why ModalEnergy is not outputing files?
  3. cannot make nektar compile in hpc.



- Have a look at nohup after the '&' in commands to run in the background.
- add a blasius profile on the boundary layer domain.
