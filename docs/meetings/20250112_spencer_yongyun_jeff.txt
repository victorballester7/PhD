- global mode?


Change things:
 - remove sweep
 - add delta* parameter (boundary layer parameter): (more or less) boundary layer thinkness 
 - reproduce graph w/delta* vs d/delta*, d=depht domain and w=width domain
 - take d/delta* = 4 and keep increasing w/delta* from 10. the critical line is at around 20.
 - which Re? jeffrey will tell us: Re_delta* = 1000
 - compressible solver or incompressible solver? incompressible but try also a round with the compressible solver.
 - baseflow? to get the baseflow use SFD method
 - amplification curves (e^N factor, i think). check the plot. there are two numbers 1, 2 relating how the amplification number is amplified.
 - start doing the same kind of analysis with the single mode.
 - rossiter modes: compressible mode
 - run in 2d!!!!
