- to get the base flow, run the incompressible solver to get the base flow.
- you can do it with 3 valriables at once (u, v, w) setting only one fourier mode for w.
- we use quadrialteral elements in the boundary layer, for precisness and adjusting to the boundary layer.
- see stability concerns for the advection dt ~ dx/p^a.
- first start without an angle.
