    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<P> ParamName = ParamValue  </P> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Open up the session file](uDiffSession.xml) and navigate to the `SOLVERINFO` section. Underneath `SOLVERINFO`, add a new `PARAMETERS` section, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",

    "<PARAMETERS>\n",
    "    <!-- we'll add parameters here -->\n",
    "</PARAMETERS>\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Define the following parameters:\n",
    "- `TimeStep`: Defines the timestep size, which we'll set moderately to `0.001`.\n",
    "- `FinTime`: We'll solve the problem for `0.3` time units: you can choose a higher value, but this will obviously lead to increased execution time!\n",

    "- `IO_InfoSteps`: Controls the frequency that the solver prints out the information to the console. For example if we set  `IO_InfoSteps` to `100`, then every 100 steps you'll see a status update on the current integration time and walltime required. By default this is set to `1`.\n",
    "- `IO_CheckSteps`: Sets the frequency that the solution will be written out, i.e. the _checkpoint_ frequency. These files can be used to restart a simulation if it is long-running, or to visualise an animation of the unsteady solution field. For example, if we set `IO_CheckSteps` to `200`, then every 200 steps the solution will be written in a file `AdrMesh_#.chk` where `#` is the number of that step. For example at step 400, the output is `AdrMesh_2.chk`. This also causes a file `AdrMesh_0.chk` to be output with the initial condition. \n",

    "- **Task A**: Lets try to make the problem a bit more complex. Previously we used the periodic boundary conditions for top and bottom. Lets change the top boundary condition to vary over the x and be time-dependent as well, i.e set it to $u=5\\,(1.-x^2)sin(2\\pi t/4)$ as follows:\n",
    "     \n",
    "```xml\n",
    "      <REGION REF=\"2\"> <!-- Top Boundary-->\n",
    "        <D VAR=\"u\" USERDEFINEDTYPE=\"TimeDependent\" VALUE=\"5*(1-x*x)*sin(2*PI*t/4)\" />\n",
    "      </REGION>\n",
    "\n",
    "      <REGION REF=\"0\"> <!-- Bottop Boundary-->\n",
    "        <D VAR=\"u\" VALUE=\"0\" />\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please observe the `USERDEFINEDTYPE=TimeDependent` parameter used to make the boundary condition unsteady.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, lets set the initial condition to `u=0`:\n",

    "    <FUNCTION NAME=\"InitialConditions\">\n",
    "      <E VAR=\"u\"  VALUE=\"0\" />\n",
    "    </FUNCTION>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Finally, increase the final time to `FinalTime=2.0` and change the direction of y-velocity,i.e. `avy=-1.0`. Now, update these changes in the [session file](advDiffSession.xml) and run the problem.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - **A1** Before running the problem, lets clear out all the previous resutls. open a new cell (using the `+` sing in top menue), type and execute the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   `!rm *.chk *.vtu`\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - **A2** to run the problem, open another cell, type the following and run:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `!ADRSolver AdvDiff.xml advDiffSession.xml`\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - **A3** convert all the solution files. See how many checkpoint files you have, the AdvDiff_0.chk, AdvDiff_1.chk, ... . Lets assume you have n_chk file (if you have 10 output n_chk is 10 , n_chk=10 ). Further, lets assume you will name the output files as `out_0.vtu`, `out_1.vtu`, ... . Open another cell and run the following command:\n",

    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "     Now, open another cell and you can use the following to visualize your data over time:\n",
    "     \n",

    "  \n",

    "- **Task B** We run our problem using the `continuous Glerkin` projection method. We can use `Disconinuous Galerkin` as well. Change the `Projection` in the `SolverInfo` to `DisContinuous`, run and visualize the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task C**: Similar to what we did for steady-state problem and unsteady diffusion, lets increase the order of polynomial expansions by setting `NUMMODES=9` as follows:\n",
